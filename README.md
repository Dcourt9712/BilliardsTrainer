# BilliardsTrainer

This is a group project from CSCI 430 Software engineering.

Together we had created a Billiards training website to which we all worked on each individual pieces.

The main section I had worked on is the Training section because I knew the most about playing Billiards since it is one of my main hobbies.

I also helped with the accounts/login and other sections related to the backend processes of the website.
